```

## Scope of the assignment

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet () %>% 
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(lat=21.4286642, lng=86.8353152, popup="Sergarh Toll Plaza")
my_map
```
